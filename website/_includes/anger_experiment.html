    <p style="text-align: justify;">As <b>Anger</b> sat around twiddling his thumbs, feeling a bit useless in the labâ€™s experiments, he decided to dust off the old chemistry books lying around. Flipping through the pages, an idea struck him, why not add reviews into the mix of ingredients? Comparing the emotional trends between plots and reviews could uncover some fascinating parallels or surprising gaps. So, with a spark of purpose, <b>Anger</b> jumped back into action to see what this new experiment could reveal!</p>
